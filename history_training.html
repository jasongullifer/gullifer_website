 <p>I first realized my interest in languages in my German classes in secondary school. During my undergraduate studies at the <a href="http://umass.edu">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>, I became fascinated by how people understand and produce language, and I decided to pursue Linguistics and Psychology as my major.</p>

 <p>I was fortunate to take classes taught by <a href="https://www.umass.edu/linguistics/member/lyn-frazier">Lyn Frazier</a>. Inspired by the work I learned about in class, I asked about research opportunities in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ccliftonma/clifton-frazier-lab">Clifton-Frazier Lab</a>, run by <a href="http://www.umass.edu/pbs/people/charles-clifton">Chuck Clifton</a> and <a href="https://people.umass.edu/lyn/">Lyn Frazier</a>. They had an open position, and I began working on various lab projects, including my senior thesis.</p>

<p>After receiving my B.A. in 2007, I worked at Penn State as a Research Technologist in the <a href="http://cls.psu.edu">Center for Language Science</a>, Judy Kroll's Language and Cognition Laboratory, and Giuli Dussias'  <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Home.html">IS&Iacute; (I see) Eye-tracking Laboratory</a>. I helped the center faculty build their shared research lab space, and I helped out with other administrative duties. I conducted  psycholinguistic studies on bilingual language processing, including some tricky data preparation. I was also the resident webmaster for the CLS.</p>

<p>In 2009 I became a graduate student in the Psychology Department at Penn State where I continued working with Judy Kroll and Giuli Dussias. I received my MS in Psychology in 2011. I then received my dual-title PhD in Psychology and Language Science from The Pennsylvania State University in 2015.</p>
    
<p>In 2015, I moved to Montr&eacute;al to join McGill University as an NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/perpg/fac/titone/index.html">McGill Language &amp; Multilingualism Laboratory</a>, under the direction of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/debra-titone">Debra Titone</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/denise-klein-lab/lab">Language Experience and the Brain Laboratory</a>, under the direction of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/klein">Denise Klein</a>.</p>
