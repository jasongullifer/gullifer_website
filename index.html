	      I am a post-doctoral researcher at McGill University. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology and Language Science at <a href="http://www.psu.edu">The Pennsylvania State University</a> in 2015. After, I moved to Montreal as an <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8982287&icde=26640610">NIH-funded post-doctoral fellow</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>. 

	      <p>I study the dynamic relationships between language, cognition, and brain organization. I am particularly interested in quantifying how these relationships depend on individual differences in everyday language experience, including bilingualism and multilingualism. </p>
		  
		  <p>I first realized my interest in languages in my German classes in high school. During my undergraduate studies at the <a href="http://umass.edu">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>, I became interested in how people understand and produce language, and I decided to pursue Linguistics and Psychology as my major. After receiving my B.A. in 2007, I joined the <a href="http://cls.psu.edu">Center for Language Science</a> as a Research Technologist. Working for the Center, I helped conduct psycholinguistic studies on bilingual language processing before entering the graduate program in Psychology. In 2011 I received my M.S. from Penn State.
