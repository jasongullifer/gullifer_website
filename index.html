	      I am a Research Associate at McGill University. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology and Language Science at <a href="http://www.psu.edu">The Pennsylvania State University</a> in 2015, working with <a href="https://bilingualismmindbrain.com/lab-members/judith-f-kroll/">Judy Kroll</a> and <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Home.html">Giuli Dussias</a>. After, I moved to Montr√©al as an <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8982287&icde=26640610">NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>. I work in Debra Titone's <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/language-lab/">Language and Multilingualism Laboratory</a> </p>

	     <p>I investigate the cognitive, linguistic, and neural mechanisms that allow people to manage language-related uncertainties that occur in their environments. I use bilingualism as a lens to study these processes because <strong>bilinguals become experts in managing language-related uncertainties at multiple levels</strong>. My work shows that <strong>aspects of language diversity impact neurocognitive and linguistic outcomes</strong>.</p>

	     <p>I use several experimental methodologies in my research, including questionnaires, behavioral responses, eye tracking, and neuroimaging. Recently, I have begun incorporating machine learning and network science as methods to build and test cognitive models of language use and executive control. When combined, these methods are highly suited to revealing  neurocognitive adaptations that occur as a function of real-world language experience.</p>
