	      I am a Research Associate at McGill University. I received my Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology and Language Science at <a href="http://www.psu.edu">The Pennsylvania State University</a> in 2015. After, I moved to Montr√©al as an <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8982287&icde=26640610">NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow</a> at <a href="http://mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>. </p>

	     <p>I investigate the cognitive, linguistic, and neural mechanisms that allow people to manage language-related uncertainties that occur in their environments. I use bilingualism as a lens to study these processes because bilinguals become experts in managing language-related uncertainties at multiple levels.</p>

	     <p>I use several experimental methodologies in my research, including questionnaires, behavioral responses, eye tracking, and neuroimaging. When combined, these methods are highly suited to revealing  neurocognitive adaptations that occur as a function of real-world language experience. Recently, I have begun to incorporate machine learning and network science as methods to build and test cognitive models of language use and executive control.</p>

		  <p>I first realized my interest in languages in my German classes in secondary school. During my undergraduate studies at the <a href="http://umass.edu">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>, I became fascinated by how people understand and produce language, and I decided to pursue Linguistics and Psychology as my major. After receiving my B.A. in 2007, I joined the <a href="http://cls.psu.edu">Center for Language Science</a> at Penn State as a Research Assistant. Working for the Center, I helped conduct psycholinguistic studies on bilingual language processing.
