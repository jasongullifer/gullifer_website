    <p>I study the dynamic relationships between language, cognition, and brain organization. I am particularly interested in quantifying how these relationships depend on individual differences in everyday language experience, including bilingualism and multilingualism. My research has been funded from multiple sources, including the National Science Foundation (USA), the National Institutes of Health (USA), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada).</p>

    <p>Below you can find some more information about my main research questions. This work is conducted variously in collaboration with colleagues at Penn State University; University of California, Irvine; and McGill University.</p></p>


    <h4>How do various types of context influence cross-language competition?</h4>

    <p>Bilingual readers experience constant competition between the languages that they know. This makes bilinguals an ideal population to study a fundamental question in language science: how context guides comprehension. My research shows that bilingual readers are sensitive to multiple sources of information during reading, including the language required by the task (<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/abstract">Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, 2013</a> <span data-badge-popover="right" data-badge-type="4" data-doi="10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278" data-hide-no-mentions="true" class="altmetric-embed"></span>, <em>Frontiers Front. Psychol.</em>; <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-14528-001">Gullifer & Titone, 2019</a>, <em>J. Exp. Psychol. Learn. Mem. Cogn.</em>) and the syntactic properties of the sentences being read (Gullifer, Kroll, Berry, Navarro-Torres, in prep). These factors momentarily perturb cross-language competition at the word level, and these findings run counter to dominant models of word recognition that predict that processing at this level should be isolated from surrounding context. 


    <h4>How can we quantify everyday language experience? </h4>

    <p>Bilingualism has been shown to impact many core neurocognitive processes, including language learning, language processing, and executive control. However, a crucial issue in all of these literatures is that past research focuses almost entirely on the age at which language is learned and the proficiency that is ultimately attained by the time of testing. However, bilinguals and multilinguals exhibit diversity in how they use the languages that they know. My work shows that factors such as age of acquisition and proficiency are not sufficient to investigate core issues of interest. Instead, I show that it is important to accurately characterize the social use of language across communicative contexts (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393218301878">Gullifer, et al., 2018</a>, <em>Neuropsychologia</em>; <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/characterizing-the-social-diversity-of-bilingualism-using-language-entropy/BCA277F72A02D8834C53E4F9090FF7FD">Gullifer & Titone, 2019</a>, <em>Biling.: Lang. Cogn.</em>).</p> 

    <p>I am developing a theoretical perspective and methodological tools to help other scientists quantify these individual differences. For example, I developed (and am currently validating) a measure, <em>language entropy</em>, that continuously quantifies how individuals use the languages that they know across communicative and social contexts. I have made an R package available to compute this measure on <a href="https://github.com/jasongullifer/languageEntropy">GitHub</a>.

    <h4>What insights about language & cognition can we gather from machine learning?</h4>

    <p>Two broad goals of science are to explain existing data and predict new data. However, the former is more emphasized in Psychology than the latter. This has potential limitations, including the generation of complex models and theories that potentially overfit noise in data and high variance in outcomes across studies. In contrast, machine learning approaches heavily emphasize prediction. I have begun to apply machine learning approaches, including cross-validation and regularization in my research to assess whether statistical effects observed are predictive of novel, unmodeled data to further enhance reliability (Gullifer & Titone, submitted). Mainstream psychology is entering the age of machine leaning, and it is currently unknown which experimental effects are predictive of novel, unmodeled data.</p>

    <h3>Research training</h3>
    <h4>Undergraduate research</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.umass.edu/"><img src="images/umass.png" alt="UMass" width="200"  hspace="10"/></a></p><br/>
    <p>I received my BA in Linguistics and Psychology from The University of Massachusetts Amherst in 2007. At UMass, I worked in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ccliftonma/clifton-frazier-lab">The Clifton-Frazier Lab</a> under the direction of <a href="http://www.umass.edu/pbs/people/charles-clifton">Charles Clifton</a> and <a href="https://people.umass.edu/lyn/">Lyn Frazier</a>.</p>
<br/>
    
    <h4>Post-baccalaureate research</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.psu.edu/"><img src="images/psu.png" alt="PSU" width="200"  hspace="10"/></a></p><br/>
    <p>Following my undergraduate studies, I joined The Pennsylvania State University community as a Research Technologist in the <a href="http://cls.psu.edu">Center for Language Science</a>. The CLS is an interdisciplinary group of linguists, psycholinguists, applied linguists, speech-language pathologists, speech scientists, and cognitive neuroscientists who share a common interest in language acquisition and bilingualism. From 2007 - 2009, I was the resident webmaster for the CLS and conducted various administrative duties.</p>
    
    <p>In addition to working in the Center for Language Science, I also spent a large portion of my time working in the <a href="http://personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Home.html">IS&Iacute; (I see) Eye-tracking Laboratory</a> with <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Welcome.html">Paola Dussias</a> and in the <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/judithfkroll/">Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain Lab</a> with <a href="https://sites.psu.edu/judithfkroll/lab-members/judith-f-kroll/">Judith Kroll</a>.</p>
<br/>
    <h4>Masters and Doctoral research</h4>
    <p><a href="http://www.psu.edu/"><img src="images/psu.png" alt="PSU" width="200"  hspace="10"/></a></p><br/>
    <p>In 2009 I became a graduate student in the Psychology Department at Penn State where I continued working with Judith Kroll and Paola Dussias. I received my MS in Psychology in 2011. I then received my dual-title PhD in Psychology and Language Science from The Pennsylvania State University in 2015.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <h4>Post-doctoral research</h4>
    <p><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/"><img src="images/mcgill.png" alt="McGill" width="200"  hspace="10"/></a></p><br/>

    <p>In 2015, I moved to Montr&eacute;al to join McGill University as an NIH-funded postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/perpg/fac/titone/index.html">McGill Language &amp; Multilingualism Laboratory</a>, under the direction of <a href="http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/perpg/fac/titone/labmembers/dtitone/dtitone.html">Debra Titone</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/denise-klein-lab/lab">Language Experience and the Brain Laboratory</a>, under the direction of <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/research/researchers/klein">Denise Klein</a>.</p>
