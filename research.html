    <p>I am interested in how bilingual individuals manage and control their two languages and in whether there are broader cognitive and neural consequences of exercising this control throughout daily life. To date, there is copious evidence that bilinguals coactivate information about both of their languages even when they intend to use a single language. In my work, I investigate whether bilinguals can exploit contextual cues (such as the requirement to use one language and not the other) and linguistic cues (such as cross-linguistic differences) to select the intended language during comprehension and production. I also investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie language control.</p>

    <p>Below you can find more information about these threads of work. They were conducted together in collaboration with mentors and colleagues at Penn State University; University of California, Riverside; or McGill University. My research projects have, at various times, been supported by the National Science Foundation (USA), the National Institutes of Health (USA), and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada).</p>

    <h4>Contextual and linguistic mechanisms of language control</h4>
    <p> Overall, I show that it is surprisingly difficult for bilinguals to reduce activation of the unintended language. The requirement to read only in Spanish or only in English does not change the extent to which both languages are activated for highly proficient Spanish-English bilinguals. We (<a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/abstract">Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, 2013</a>) report similar magnitudes of co-activation for these single language conditions as for conditions in which both languages are required. <em>Frontiers</em>, estimates that our report is in the <a href="http://loop-impact.frontiersin.org/impact/article/45237#totalviews/views">top 10%</a> of its articles in terms of impact, and this work has been featured in some press releases (e.g., <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=129060&org=NSF&from=news">by the NSF</a>) and by various media outlets (e.g., <a href="http://news.psu.edu/story/286926/2013/09/10/research/think-twice-speak-once-bilinguals-process-both-languages">Penn State News</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/09/130910121521.htm">Science Daily</a>, and <a href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2013/09/11/bilingual-speakers-develop-mental-flexibility/59404.html">Psych Central</a>).</p>

<p>In my dissertation (funded by an <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1331709&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Dissertation Research Improvement Grant</a>), I assess whether bilinguals who are fluent speakers of Spanish and English can use syntactic structures that are specific to Spanish to reduce or eliminate co-activation from English. At present, this work is being written up for publication.</p> 

    <h4>Cognitive and neural mechanisms of language control</h4>
    <p>I am also interested in the cognitive mechanisms that underlie bilingual language processing. Many studies show that bilinguals recruit inhibitory or attentional mechanisms to suppress co-activation from the unintended language and direct attention toward the target language. A growing body of literature suggests that a life-time of experience using these executive control mechanisms can result in changes to the brain networks that support language and executive control, and may help shield against the symptoms of age-related cognitive decline and dementia in comparison to monolingual speakers. My recent work investigates the universality of these mechanisms and the extent to which individual differences in language experience underlie these neurocognitive changes.</p>

    <p>One question of interest is the universality of bilingual recruitment of executive control mechanisms. Most bilinguals tested in psycholinguistic experiments are highly educated, literate adults who are attending or who have attended research universities, but this profile is not representative of all language users. We (<a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/ped10/Giuli_Dussias/Publications/External/Dussias_Gullifer_Poepsel_2016.pdf">Dussias, Gullifer, & Poepsel, 2016</a>) show that bilingual speakers of Spanish and Palenquero, a creole language spoken in Columbia that traditionally has no standardized writing system (though this is changing), recruit similar inhibitory mechanisms as reported in typical psycholinguistic experiments on bilingualism. This finding also has consequences for linguistic debates about whether Palenquero is merging with Spanish, one of Palenquero's source languages. Specifically, they suggest that the two languages are distinctly represented in the minds of the bilinguals in our sample. To our knowledge, this may be the first reported study on language control in a population of creole-speaking bilinguals.</p>

    <p>Another question of interest is what the neural mechanisms are that the underlie language control. There is now a general consensus that there are several interrelated networks, or circuits, in the brain that accomplish various cognitive tasks, such as memory, language, and various forms of executive control. There is also a general consensus that the networks for language and executive control are tightly integrated for bilingual speakers. In a paper forthcoming in <em>Neuropsychologia</em>, we (Gullifer et al., 2018; preprint available <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/24xcv/">here</a>) show that individual differences in bilingual experience (both in terms of language acquisition history and current daily usage) are associated with intrinsic brain organization. We replicate a finding that bilinguals who acquire their two languages early in life have highly connected frontal brain regions which are thought to be involved in language and inhibitory control. Crucially, we also show a novel result: that the diversity of language use (i.e., the extent to which two languages are used together in various social settings) is also associated with intrinsic brain organization. Specifically, bilinguals who use their two languages in a highly diverse fashion (i.e., to a similar extent throughout their social spheres) show greater connectivity in a subcortical brain network associated with attention, contextual integration, and language articulation. These results suggest that both acquisition and daily use matter for brain organization of networks involved in language and executive control. </p>
