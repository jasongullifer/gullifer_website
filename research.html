    <p>Language is filled with uncertainties, and people who know multiple languages manage several uncertainties across linguistic systems. In my interdisciplinary research program, I investigate the mechanisms that allow people to develop expertise in managing the uncertainties they encounter in their environments. I use multilingualism as a lens to study these issues. For a recent manifesto on language-related uncertainty, check out Gullifer and Titone (<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/nol/article/doi/10.1162/nol_a_00044/102705/Bilingualism-A-Neurocognitive-Exercise-in-Managing">2021</a>).</p>

    <p>To pursue my research goals, I employ multiple methodologies (including eye tracking, neuroimaging, questionnaires, and behavioral responses), which are optimal for revealing associations between real-world experience, language processing, brain dynamics, and executive control. I use methods and tools that reduce or capitalize on the multivariate nature of the problem space to better identify the constructs and variables that are theoretically and statistically relevant, including entropy measures, principal component analysis, machine learning, and network analysis.</p>

    
    <p>My work is supported by several research grants I have secured from international agencies (US and Canadian), including NSF (as co-PI on a dissertation improvement award), NIH (as PI on a F32 postdoctoral fellowship), and SSHRC (as PI on two Insight Development Grants, and as co-PI on one Insight Grant).</p>

<h3>Quantifying complex multilingual experience with language entropy</h3>

    <p>I developed a methodological approach using entropy (a measure of uncertainty and diversity; Shannon, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1538-7305.1948.tb01338.x">1948</a>). Language entropy estimates individual- and contextual-level differences in the extent to which multiple languages are engaged (Gullifer et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393218301878">2018</a>, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/abs/bilingual-language-experience-as-a-multidimensional-spectrum-associations-with-objective-and-subjective-language-proficiency/2F17D64FD577C3AD19640C1BBC58123D">2020</a>; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/characterizing-the-social-diversity-of-bilingualism-using-language-entropy/BCA277F72A02D8834C53E4F9090FF7FD">2019</a>, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-73247-001">2021</a>). When two or more languages are engaged equally often, language entropy is high. When one language dominates, language entropy is low. Language entropy indexes the degree of language-related uncertainty for an individual or environment: in high entropy situations when multiple languages are equally likely, uncertainty is also high (Gullifer & Titone, 2021). The measure can be computed from self-report or objective data about language usage in different contexts (e.g., language use in the home vs. language use at work), and I developed and tested an open-source <a href="https://github.com/jasongullifer/languageEntropy">R package</a> to compute it from questionnaire data</p>

    <img class="center" src="images/entropy_distribution.png" alt="ldistribution of language entropy across different social contexts french-english bilinguals in montreal. contexts like reading and writing for work purposes have low language entropy. contexts like thinking and dreaming have high language entropy." width="800" hspace="10" align="middle"/>

<h3>Bilingualism adapts the neurocognitive system</h3>

    <p>In my work on bilingualism and neurocognitive adaptation, I treat language experience as set of interrelated continua, including language entropy, sheer amount of exposure, and age of language acquisition. In a series of publications, I found that these aspects jointly predict language proficiency, measured through self-report questionnaires and experimental tasks (e.g., verbal fluency). People with high degrees of L2 usage, high language entropy, or who acquired the two languages early in life tended to exhibit higher proficiency (Gullifer et al., <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/applied-psycholinguistics/article/abs/bilingual-language-experience-as-a-multidimensional-spectrum-associations-with-objective-and-subjective-language-proficiency/2F17D64FD577C3AD19640C1BBC58123D">2021</a>; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bilingualism-language-and-cognition/article/abs/characterizing-the-social-diversity-of-bilingualism-using-language-entropy/BCA277F72A02D8834C53E4F9090FF7FD">2019</a>). These findings provide core validation for these bilingual experience features, including language-related uncertainty, and analytical methods that treat these factors jointly and continuously.</p>

    <p>In a related line of work, I applied this approach to study brain organization and executive control. I found that age of language acquisition and language entropy predict the resting-state connectivity of unique brain networks involved in control (Gullifer et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0028393218301878">2018</a>), replicating and extending earlier work from the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/denise-klein-lab/lab">Klein lab</a> at the Montréal Neurological Institute (Berken et al., <a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/4/1165?utm_source=TrendMD&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=JNeurosci_TrendMD_0">2016</a>). While early age of acquisition predicted greater frontal connectivity, high language entropy predicted greater connectivity among a broad network of areas see. Connectivity in these areas further predicted individuals’ goal-maintenance and proactive control abilities measured by an AX-continuous performance task. I found that the behavioral results replicated in a large sample (N = 400+; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-73247-001">2021</a>). Together, attention to goal-relevant cues may be important for high entropy bilinguals who must rapidly discover what language will come next in uncertain language situations so they can identify and maintain goal-relevant attentional information.</p>


<h3>Using machine learning to inform neurocognitive theories</h3>
    <p>We are in the midst of a data explosion. Teams of researchers routinely collect data online and in-person for many different measures, methodologies, and (ideally) participants. These data inform increasingly complex theoretical questions. Yet, in my estimation, the analytical methods in the social and behavioral sciences have not kept up with the surge of data. For related reasons, we are simultaneously in the midst of a replication crisis, where foundational results fail to replicate. </p>

    <p>Study preregistration and the adoption of open science practices have helped to address and mitigate the structural issues leading to the replication crisis. However, these practices may leave researchers feeling constrained in their ability to creatively explore unique and exciting questions at a time when more data are available than ever before. These issues mirror the growing pains experienced in machine learning at the onset of the “big data phenomenon” in industry. My research program is informed by modern practices from machine learning and data science. I employ and implement methods that reduce data dimensionality or capitalize on the multivariate nature of the problem space to identify the constructs that contribute the most signal while maintaining statistical accuracy and generalizability to new samples. </p>

    <p>In my ongoing work, I am combining traditional inferential statistical methods and predictive machine learning methods to adjudicate between different models of executive control (Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-73247-001">2021</a>). The models differed in the extent to which features related to bilingualism impact (or interact to impact) executive control, thus mapping on to different theoretical perspectives. I found broad agreement between multiple model architectures (i.e., mixed-effects regression models and least absolute shrinkage selection models) that features indexing bilingual language experience better predicted executive control abilities vs. baseline models. Importantly, I confirmed that all models showed evidence of cross-validation: a keystone method in machine learning where model performance is tested against unmodeled data points to ensure reliability.</p>

    <p>Below, you can watch a 15-minute talk on this topic (presented at Psychonomics 2020). You can also check out the project on <a href="https://osf.io/eaks2/">OSF</a>.</p>
    
    <div style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gY1onZKGrNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

    <p>As part of this work, I implemented the computational methods for k-fold cross-validation of linear and logistic regression models (including mixed effects models). The approach I developed, combining inferential and predictive methods, allowed me to maximally interrogate the dataset without relying on problematic metrics like p-values and while providing evidence of reliability and model accuracy. Traditionally, inferential and predictive techniques have occupied distinct philosophical spaces in science, yet their combination holds high value for the future of the social and behavioral sciences where increasingly powerful analytical methods are being adopted. Following the initial publication in this line of work, Hofman and colleagues (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03659-0">2021</a>) contributed a perspective piece in Nature: Human Behavior further outlining and advocating for a nearly identical approach that they termed “integrative modeling.”</p>


<h3>Using network science to model the social engagement of language </h3>
    <p>Many aspects of cognition and language can be modeled as networks: areas in the brain, words in the mental lexicon, interactions between individuals in the environment, and so on. While network models of multilingual language use have been constructed from sources of online usage, like Twitter (e.g., Eleta & Golbeck, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002830?casa_token=0uVkRENNAhQAAAAA:ZNj54a67ZRYDYye9m5eLJHW-DeWn6ICUgNdU4CHdjT4mnQWzeNng4U7FMM0hV6vVVeECuFPO3Rc">2014</a>), they have not been widely constructed from in-person usage.</p> 

    <p>In recent work with the Social Network Team in the Titone lab, we used networks to model data about individuals’ language engagement for various topics of conversation (e.g., politics, sports, moral issues, religious issues) as a way to compare languages and contexts of usage (e.g., formal vs. informal settings; Tiv, Gullifer, et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0911604419302015">2020</a>). We treated topics as nodes and connected them via edges if they occurred in the same language. We then weighted the edges by the number of contexts in which they occurred. Analyses showed that dominant language networks were larger (more topic nodes) and more integrated (higher density, higher edge strength) compared to the non-dominant language. In other words, people reported talking about more topics across a broader array of contexts in their dominant vs. non-dominant language. Crucially, community detection (via the Louvain algorithm) revealed more communities of topics (i.e., densely connected groups) in the non-dominant language. This suggests that the non-dominant language is leveraged for a greater number of specialized purposes within the Montréal context, potentially as a means of controlling language-related uncertainty. </p>

<h3>Language-related uncertainty at lower levels of language processing</h3>

    <p>Language-related uncertainties occur when people, such as monolingual English speakers, encounter ambiguous words with multiple meanings, such as the word “bank” which could refer to the edge of land near a body of water or a financial institution. However, such uncertainties are greater for bilinguals or multilinguals because virtually every concept can minimally be ascribed to a word in each language and word forms can be ambiguous across languages. For example, in Spanish, <em>un vaso</em> is a drinking glass, but the word form looks strikingly like the English word vase. While these concepts are distinct, I use traditional psycholinguistic methods, including eye-tracking, to demonstrate that even highly proficient bilinguals experience momentary competition between conflicting meanings in the irrelevant language during spoken comprehension (Titone, Mercier, Sudarshan, Pivneva, Gullifer, & Baum, <a href="https://benjamins.com/online/lab/articles/lab.18028.tit">2020</a>), written comprehension (Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/abstract">2013</a>; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-14528-001">2019</a>, and production (Dussias, Gullifer, & Poepsel, <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/book/9783954878949/10.31819/9783954878949-010.xml">2016</a>; Gullifer et al., <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/full">2013</a>).
