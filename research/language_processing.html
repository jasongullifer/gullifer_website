<h3>Language-related uncertainty at lower levels of language processing</h3>

    <p>Language-related uncertainties occur when people, such as monolingual English speakers, encounter ambiguous words with multiple meanings, such as the word “bank” which could refer to the edge of land near a body of water or a financial institution. However, such uncertainties are greater for bilinguals or multilinguals because virtually every concept can minimally be ascribed to a word in each language and word forms can be ambiguous across languages. For example, in Spanish, <em>un vaso</em> is a drinking glass, but the word form looks strikingly like the English word vase. While these concepts are distinct, I use traditional psycholinguistic methods, including eye-tracking, to demonstrate that even highly proficient bilinguals experience momentary competition between conflicting meanings in the irrelevant language during spoken comprehension (Titone, Mercier, Sudarshan, Pivneva, Gullifer, & Baum, <a href="/papers#titoneSpokenWordProcessing2021">2020</a>), written comprehension (Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, <a href="/papers#gulliferWhenLanguageSwitching2013">2013</a>; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="/papers#gulliferImpactMomentaryLanguage2019a">2019</a>, and production (Dussias, Gullifer, & Poepsel, <a href="/papers#dussiasHowPsycholinguisticsCan2016">2016</a>; Gullifer et al., <a href="/papers#gulliferWhenLanguageSwitching2013">2013</a>).
