<h3>Language-related uncertainty at lower levels of language processing</h3>

    <p>Language-related uncertainties occur when people, such as monolingual English speakers, encounter ambiguous words with multiple meanings, such as the word “bank” which could refer to the edge of land near a body of water or a financial institution. However, such uncertainties are greater for bilinguals or multilinguals because virtually every concept can minimally be ascribed to a word in each language and word forms can be ambiguous across languages. For example, in Spanish, <em>un vaso</em> is a drinking glass, but the word form looks strikingly like the English word vase. While these concepts are distinct, I use traditional psycholinguistic methods, including eye-tracking, to demonstrate that even highly proficient bilinguals experience momentary competition between conflicting meanings in the irrelevant language during spoken comprehension (Titone, Mercier, Sudarshan, Pivneva, Gullifer, & Baum, <a href="https://benjamins.com/online/lab/articles/lab.18028.tit">2020</a>), written comprehension (Gullifer, Kroll, & Dussias, <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/abstract">2013</a>; Gullifer & Titone, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-14528-001">2019</a>, and production (Dussias, Gullifer, & Poepsel, <a href="https://www.degruyter.com/view/book/9783954878949/10.31819/9783954878949-010.xml">2016</a>; Gullifer et al., <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00278/full">2013</a>).
