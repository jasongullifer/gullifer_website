  Bilingual and multilingual individuals exhibit variation in everyday language experience.
  Studies on bilingualism account for individual differences with measures such as L2 age of
  acquisition, exposure, or language proficiency, but recent theoretical perspectives posit that the
  relative balance between the two or more languages throughout daily life (i.e., INTERACTIONAL
  CONTEXT) is a crucial determinant for language representation, access, and control. We propose
  an innovative measure to characterize this construct by using ENTROPY to estimate the social
  diversity of language use. Language entropy is computed from commonly-collected language
  history data and generalizes to multilingual communicative contexts. We show how language
  entropy relates to other indices of bilingual experience and that it predicts self-report L2 outcome
  measures over and above classic measures of language experience. Thus, we proffer language
  entropy as a means to characterize individual differences in bilingual (and multilingual) language
  experience related to the social diversity of language use.
