    We investigated the independent contributions of second language (L2) age of
    acquisition (AoA) and social diversity of language use on intrinsic brain
    organization using seed-based resting-state functional connectivity among
    highly proficient French-English bilinguals. There were two key findings.
    First, earlier L2 AoA related to greater interhemispheric functional
    connectivity between homologous frontal brain regions, and to decreased
    reliance on proactive executive control in an AX-Continuous Performance Task
    completed outside the scanner. Second, greater diversity in social language
    use in daily life related to greater connectivity between the anterior
    cingulate cortex and the putamen bilaterally, and to increased reliance on
    proactive control in the same task. These findings suggest that early vs.
    late L2 AoA links to a specialized neural framework for processing two
    languages that may engage a specific type of executive control (e.g.,
    reactive control). In contrast, higher vs. lower degrees of diversity in
    social language use link to a broadly distributed set of brain networks
    implicated in proactive control and context monitoring.
