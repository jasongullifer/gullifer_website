    We investigated whether cross-language activation is sensitive to shifting
    language demands and language experience during first and second language
    (i.e., L1, L2) reading. Experiment 1 consisted of L1 French–L2 English
    bilinguals reading in the L2, and Experiment 2 consisted of L1 English–L2
    French bilinguals reading in the L1. Both groups read English sentences with
    target words serving as indices of cross-language activation: cross-language
    homographs, cognates, and matched language-unique control words. Critically,
    we manipulated whether English sentences contained a momentary language
    switch into French before downstream target words. This allowed us to assess
    the consequences of shifting language demands, both in the moment, and
    residually following a switch as a function of language experience. Switches
    into French were associated with a reading cost at the switch site for both
    L2 and L1 readers. However, downstream cross-language activation was larger
    following a switch only for L1 readers. These results suggest that
    cross-language activation is jointly sensitive to momentary shifts in
    language demands and language experience, likely reflecting different
    control demands faced by L2 versus L1 readers, consistent with models of
    bilingual processing that ascribe a primary role for language control.
