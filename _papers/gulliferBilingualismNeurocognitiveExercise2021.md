    Bilinguals have distinct linguistic experiences relative to monolinguals,
    stemming from interactions with the environment and individuals therein.
    Theories of language control hypothesize that these experiences play a role
    in adapting the neurocognitive systems responsible for control. Here we
    posit a potential mechanism for these adaptations, namely that bilinguals
    face additional language-related uncertainties on top of other ambiguities
    that regularly occur in language, such as lexical and syntactic competition.
    When faced with uncertainty in the environment, people adapt internal
    representations to lessen these uncertainties, which can aid in executive
    control and decision-making.We overview a cognitive framework on
    uncertainty, which we extend to language and bilingualism. We then review
    two “case studies” assessing language-related uncertainty for bilingual
    contexts using language entropy and network scientific approaches. Overall,
    we find that there is substantial individual variability in the extent to
    which people experience language related uncertainties in their
    environments, but also regularity across some contexts. This information, in
    turn, predicts cognitive adaptations associated with language fluency and
    engagement in proactive cognitive control strategies. These findings suggest
    that bilinguals adapt to the cumulative language-related uncertainties in
    the environment.We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and
    links with other research domains. Ultimately, a focus on uncertainty will
    help bridge traditionally separate scientific domains, such as language
    processing, bilingualism, and decision-making.
