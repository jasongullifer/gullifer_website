    Despite the multifactorial space of language experience in which people
    continuously vary, bilinguals are often dichotomized into ostensibly
    homogeneous groups. The timing of language exposure (age of acquisition) to
    a second language (L2) is one well-studied construct that is known to impact
    language processing, cognitive processing, and brain organization, but
    recent work shows that current language exposure is also a crucial
    determinant in these domains. Critically, many indices of bilingual
    experience are inherently subjective and based on self-report
    questionnaires. Such measures have been criticized in favor of objective
    measures of language ability (e.g., naming ability or verbal fluency). Here,
    we estimate the bilingual experience jointly as a function of multiple
    continuous aspects of experience, including the timing of language exposure,
    the amount of L2 exposure across communicative contexts, and language
    entropy (a flexible measure of language balance) across communicative
    contexts. The results suggest that current language exposure exhibits
    distinct but interrelated patterns depending on the socio-experiential
    context of language usage. They also suggest that, counterintuitively, our
    sample more accurately self-assesses L2 proficiency than native language
    proficiency. A precise quantification of the multidimensional nature of
    bilingualism will enhance the ability of future research to assess language
    processing, acquisition, and control.
