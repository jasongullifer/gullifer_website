    We used insights from machine learning to address an important but
    contentious question: Is bilingual language experience associated with
    executive control abilities? Specifically, we assess proactive executive
    control for over 400 young adult bilinguals via reaction time (RT) on an AX
    continuous performance task (AX-CPT). We measured bilingual experience as a
    continuous, multidimensional spectrum (i.e., age of acquisition, language
    entropy, and sheer second language exposure). Linear mixed effects
    regression analyses indicated significant associations between bilingual
    language experience and proactive control, consistent with previous work.
    Information criteria (e.g., AIC) and cross-validation further suggested that
    these models are robust in predicting data from novel, unmodeled
    participants. These results were bolstered by cross-validated LASSO
    regression, a form of penalized regression. However, the results of both
    cross-validation procedures also indicated that similar predictive
    performance could be achieved through simpler models that only included
    information about the AX-CPT (i.e., trial type). Collectively, these results
    suggest that the effects of bilingual experience on proactive control, to
    the extent that they exist in younger adults, are likely small. Thus, future
    studies will require even larger or qualitatively different samples (e.g.,
    older adults or children) in combination with valid, granular
    quantifications of language experience to reveal predictive effects on novel
    participants.
