    Abstract We investigated whether bilingual older adults experience within-
    and cross-language competition during spoken word recognition similarly to
    younger adults matched on age of second language (L2) acquisition, objective
    and subjective L2 proficiency, and current L2 exposure. In a visual world
    eye-tracking paradigm, older and younger adults, who were French-dominant or
    English-dominant English-French bilinguals, listened to English words, and
    looked at pictures including the target (field), a within-language
    competitor (feet) or cross-language (French) competitor (fille, “girl”), and
    unrelated filler pictures while their eye movements were monitored. Older
    adults showed evidence of greater within-language competition as a function
    of increased target and competitor phonological overlap. There was some
    evidence of age-related differences in cross-language competition, however,
    it was quite small overall and varied as a function of target language
    proficiency. These results suggest that greater within- and possibly
    cross-language lexical competition during spoken word recognition may
    underlie some of the communication difficulties encountered by healthy
    bilingual older adults.
