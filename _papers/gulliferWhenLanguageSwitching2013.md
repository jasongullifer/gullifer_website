    We report two experiments that investigate the effects of sentence context
    on bilingual lexical access in Spanish and English. Highly proficient
    Spanish-English bilinguals read sentences in Spanish and English that
    included a marked word to be named. The word was either a cognate with
    similar orthography and/or phonology in the two languages, or a matched
    non-cognate control. Sentences appeared in one language alone (i.e., Spanish
    or English) and target words were not predictable on the basis of the
    preceding semantic context. In Experiment 1, we mixed the language of the
    sentence within a block such that sentences appeared in an alternating run
    in Spanish or in English. These conditions partly resemble normally
    occurring inter-sentential code-switching. In these mixed-language
    sequences, cognates were named faster than non-cognates in both languages.
    There were no effects of switching the language of the sentence. In
    Experiment 2, with Spanish-English bilinguals matched closely to those who
    participated in the first experiment, we blocked the language of the
    sentences to encourage language-specific processes. The results were
    virtually identical to those of the mixed-language experiment. In both
    cases, target cognates were named faster than non-cognates, and the
    magnitude of the effect did not change according to the broader context.
    Taken together, the results support the predictions of the Bilingual
    Interactive Activation + Model (Dijkstra and van Heuven, 2002) in
    demonstrating that bilingual lexical access is language non-selective even
    under conditions in which language-specific cues should enable selective
    processing. They also demonstrate that, in contrast to lexical switching
    from one language to the other, inter-sentential code-switching of the sort
    in which bilinguals frequently engage, imposes no significant costs to
    lexical processing.
