    Recent work within the language sciences, particularly bilingualism, has
    sought new methods to evaluate and characterize how people differentially
    use language across different communicative contexts. These differences have
    thus far been linked to changes in cognitive control strategy, reading
    behavior, and brain organization. Here, we approach this issue using a novel
    application of Network Science to map the conversational topics that
    Montréal bilinguals discuss across communicative contexts (e.g., work, home,
    family, school, social), in their dominant vs. non-dominant language. Our
    results demonstrate that all communicative contexts display a unique pattern
    in which conversational topics are discussed, but only a few communicative
    contexts (work and social) display a unique pattern of how many languages
    are used to discuss particular topics. We also demonstrate that the dominant
    language has greater network size, strength, and density than the
    non-dominant language, suggesting that more topics are used in a wider
    variety of contexts in this language. Lastly, using community detection to
    thematically group the topics in each language, we find evidence of greater
    specificity in the non-dominant language than the dominant language. We
    contend that Network Science is a valuable tool for representing complex
    information, such as individual differences in bilingual language use, in a
    rich and granular manner, that may be used to better understand brain and
    behavior.
